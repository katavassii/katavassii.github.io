	<h3> Hi there. As you can tell this high-end user experience aims to provide only the best. <br>
	This is why our development team is asking you to refrain from choosing any "No" responses, as those will inevitably bring the website to its demise. <br>
	We are working diligently to resolve this issue, and trust in your continued loyalty. <br> Thank you for choosing Make-A-Burger. <h3>
		
	<h1> TLDR; DON'T CHOOSE "NO" SITE BREAKS. Cheers. <h1>

	<h1>Welcome to Make-a-Burger.
